# Machine learning approach for text and document mining

In this repository I tried to implement [Machine learning approach for text and document mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1580) which includes three different algorithms:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Term Graph Model
3. k-Nearest Neighbors

I just changed the proposed dataset in the paper, In the paper they used Reuters-21578 dataset which is a very good and classic dataset but mainly it includes multi-label records which is not very suitable for the above algorithms, For the purpose of single-label classification I Used [dair-ai/emotion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion) which has more texts and more recent data.

## Future

In addition to all the good models above a want to add embedding and language models too.
